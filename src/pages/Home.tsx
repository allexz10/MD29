      Travel isn’t always pretty. It isn’t always comfortable. Sometimes it
      hurts, it even breaks your heart. But that’s okay. The journey changes
      you; it should change you. It leaves marks on your memory, on your
      consciousness, on your heart, and on your body. You take something with
      you. Hopefully, you leave something good behind.
